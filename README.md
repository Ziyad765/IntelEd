IntelEd: Personalized AI Learning Companion
IntelEd is an AI-powered adaptive learning system designed to enhance education by analyzing user emotions and dynamically adjusting lesson delivery. This project leverages Intel's OpenVINO toolkit for real-time emotion detection and GPT-based models for interactive question-and-answer sessions, creating a personalized learning experience for users.

Features
Real-Time Emotion Detection: Utilizes Intel OpenVINO to detect emotions such as happy, sad, and neutral from a webcam feed.

Interactive Q&A System: Enables students to ask questions via speech or text and provides AI-generated responses based on the detected emotion.

Dynamic Content Delivery: Adapts lesson materials based on user engagement and emotional state.

Speech-to-Text and Text-to-Speech: Converts spoken queries into text and AI responses into speech for seamless interaction.

Installation
